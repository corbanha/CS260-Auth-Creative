# Tetris-Site-with-Authentication

This project takes and expands upon my previous tetris project by adding full fledged support for users to create an account on the website and login with their Tetris scores saved. Cookies are also used to keep them logged in on their specific computer. They can update their email and other account info through an account info page. Basic security is implemented included hashing their password to ensure some basic security. Account info and data are stored on a Node.js server using a Mongo database with the ease of Mongoose and created with Express.
